/**
 * @file projectsData.ts
 * @description
 *   This file provides data for projects and blog details used within the application.
 *   It exports a list of projects grouped by certificate and a blogDetailsData array for blog posts.
 *
 *   The projects array is structured as an array of objects, each containing:
 *     - certificate: A string representing the certificate or category.
 *     - course: An array of project objects that conform to the CustomCardProps interface.
 *
 *   The blogDetailsData array holds blog post data conforming to the BlogCardProps interface.
 *   An asynchronous function (getData) is used to fetch blog data from the '/api/blogs' endpoint,
 *   and the fetched data is then pushed into blogDetailsData.
 *
 * @remarks
 *   Note: The getData function is invoked immediately so that blogDetailsData is populated
 *   when the module is imported. Ensure that the API endpoint returns data in a format that
 *   matches the BlogCardProps interface.
